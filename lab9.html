        <h1 color="blue">"Camel in eritrean history"</h1>
        <p1 color="green"> Camels have been integral to Eritrean history, serving as the "ships of the desert." These hardy animals have been invaluable in facilitating trade
             and transportation across Eritrea's diverse landscapes, from the rugged highlands to the arid lowlands. 
            Camels have carried goods, facilitated communication, and provided a means of survival in the challenging terrain.</p1>

         <h2>"The first computer"</h2>
          <p2>ENIAC's development marked a pivotal moment in the history of computing, as it was the first general-purpose, fully electronic digital computer. 
            It utilized vacuum tubes for its electronic components and was primarily designed for military purposes, particularly in the calculation of artillery firing tables. 
            It could perform a wide range of calculations much faster than human operators.</p2>

        <h3> Oldest Video ever</h3>
        <p3> One of the most notable examples of the earliest recorded video is the 1888 film, often referred to as "the oldest video ever." 
            This remarkable artifact captures scenes from a bygone era, 
            revealing a world where horse-drawn carriages shared the streets with pedestrians and bustling city life unfolded in a much different fashion.</p3>
